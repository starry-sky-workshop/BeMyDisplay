## Tips

1. When installing BeMyDisplay on Windows, you can choose to use the installation package named “BeMyDisplay-v1.0.0-setup-NeedAdminPrivileges.exe.” This will install a version of BeMyDisplay that requires “Administrator privileges” to run, providing better performance when working with Nvidia discrete graphics.

2. If you are using Windows 11 and have installed iTunes from the Microsoft Store, due to certain restrictions of the Store app, you can use BeMyDisplay normally by choosing one of the following three options:

   **Option One:**

   Open the iTunes software first, connect your iPad/iPhone to Windows using a USB data cable, and wait until the corresponding device appears in iTunes. Then run the BeMyDisplay software on Windows 11 (after running, you can click the ‘X’ in the top right corner of the window to minimize the software to the system tray), and open the BeMyDisplay app on your iOS device. At this point, your iPad/iPhone can function as an additional display for your Windows computer.

   **Option Two:**

   Uninstall the iTunes software you installed from the Microsoft Store, and download the 64-bit or 32-bit iTunes installation package from the official Apple website at https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/win64 or https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/win32, and install it. After that, you can use BeMyDisplay normally. Specifically, if your iPad/iPhone is connected to Windows via a USB data cable, you can open BeMyDisplay on both Windows and iOS at any time to turn your iPad/iPhone into an additional display for your Windows computer.

   **Option Three:**

   Uninstall the iTunes software you installed from the Microsoft Store, then reinstall BeMyDisplay. After that, you can use BeMyDisplay normally. Specifically, if your iPad/iPhone is connected to Windows via a USB data cable, you can open BeMyDisplay on both Windows and iOS at any time to turn your iPad/iPhone into an additional display for your Windows computer.
